Welcome to the osu-recalculation wiki!

# Introduction
osu! is one of worldwide rhythm games which has various impressive systems.
osu! has its own ranking system based on 'the performance point(pp)'
pp is heavily based on two factors: the score of a play and the difficulty of a playable content called 'beatmap'; 
getting higher scores on harder maps give more pp.

Difficulty of beatmaps are automatically calculated with existing algorithm, which is called `Star ratings (SR)`
Its algorithm works well roughly but has not improved for years; some issue has been stacked.
There are so-called `pp maps` in osu!; the maps are prone to give more pp than others with same skills.

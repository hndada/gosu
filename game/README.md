# Naming Convention
* Prefix keys- is put when the type is a slice with the length of keyCount.
* Prefix k- for local variables of keys-.
* Index variable ends with -i suffix.
* It is fine to put plural suffix (-s) in the middle if putting the suffix at the last is not proper (e.g., adjective)

# Keyword
ratio: two quantities with the same units
rate: two quantities with the different units

# Code
* When there are local variable and receiver field which points identical value, use local variable: prefer to use shorter one. 

* The convention of order of functions is: put referred functions first, followed by referring functions. 
* However, if a small function is used only in a single large function, then put the small at the below of the large.

* If you find any helpful information, commenting is preferred. Grammar check is not necessary at this stage.
